# Venture @ Brown

An interactive guide to help Brown and RISD navigate the entrepreneurial resources on College Hill.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Set up the development enviroment

Make sure you have a code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/aaronwangj/ventureatbrown.git
```

Navigate into the directory you just cloned and install dependencies.

```
cd ventureatbrown/frontend

npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Run the local develoment server and view the site at http://localhost:3000/
```
npm dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Deployment

This site can be deployed anywhere that supports Node.js — we find [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard) to be the easiest.
